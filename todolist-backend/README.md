# TodoList API

This is the API for the TodoList application. It's built with Express.js and uses MySQL for the database and Redis for caching.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have Node.js, MySQL, and Redis installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
```

You also need to set up your environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, and add the following variables:

```bash
DB_HOST=<your-database-host>
DB_USER=<your-database-user>
DB_PASS=<your-database-password>
DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
PORT=<port-number>
```

Finally, start the server:

```bash
npm start
```
